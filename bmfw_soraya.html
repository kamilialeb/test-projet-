    <body>
    <h1 style="text-indent:400px;">This is still a motherfucking website.</h1> 
    
    <p style="text-indent:400px;">And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>
    
    <h2 style="text-indent:400px;">Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
        
    <h4 style="text-indent:400px;">7 fucking declarations.</h4>
    
   <p style="text-indent:400px;">That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="https://google.com">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read </p>
   <p style="text-indent:400px;">masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass </p>
   <p style="text-indent:400px;">website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li style="text-indent:405px;">Shit's still lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li style="text-indent:405px;">Still fits on all your shitty screens</li>
            <li style="text-indent:405px;" >Still looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
            <li style="text-indent:405px;">The motherfucker's still accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li style="text-indent:405px;">Shit's still legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
         
        </ul>
    
    <h3 style="text-indent:400px;">And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
        
    <p style="text-indent:400px;">You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>
        
    <h2 style="text-indent:400px;">Let it breathe</h2>
        
    <p style="text-indent:400px;">Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>
        
    <p style="text-indent:400px;">If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>
    
    <h2 style="text-indent:400px;">A little less contrast</h2>
        
    <p style="text-indent:400px;">Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>
    
    <h2 style="text-indent:400px;">Size Matters</h2>
        
    <P style="text-indent:400px;">I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.</P>
        
    <h2 style="text-indent:400px;">Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
    
    <p style="text-indent:400px;">Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>
    
    <h3 style="text-indent:400px;">Yes, this is also fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
        
    <p>I love what the creator of  <a href="https://google.com">this site's inspiration</a>  did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
