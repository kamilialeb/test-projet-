<h1> This is the <em>best</em> motherfucking website.</h1>
        <p> Really , it is.</p>
        <h2> Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
        <p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB style="color:firebrick;"> motherfucking website(.com)is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
